        My name is Wesley, but everyone calls me "Wes". I'm 28 years old and I was born in Washington state. Tucson is where I call home though, having lived here most of my life. I graduated in 2007 from Marana High School (Go Tigers!) I'm an avid gamer and I also enjoy playing basketball and football. I'm happily married to my wife, Dana Hanson and I have a son named, Jace. He's basically the coolest kid you'll ever meet.
        <p> 
        Anyway, I'm in hot pursuit of mastering this coding skill. I'm super intrigued by the whole tech world and what it has to offer and I'd really like to create something of my own someday. This is a constantly growing field and very a marketable skill in today's world and I want to be a part of it! I currently work for Tucson Electric Power as an apprentice equipment operator. While it is a great career I'd like to shift gears and work with my mind rather than my body.
